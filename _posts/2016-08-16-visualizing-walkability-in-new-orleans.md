I read [this article](http://geoffboeing.com/2016/07/visualize-urban-accessibility-walkability/) on [Geoff Boeing's blog](http://geoffboeing.com/) on using network analysis with OSM data to visualize the walkability of Berklee, CA. I thought it would be interesting to run it on data from New Orleans. Since it's based on OSM data (which is probably incomplete here), it may not be the most complete picture.
