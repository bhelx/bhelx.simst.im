My name is Benjamin Eckel. This blog is mostly about technology, programming, and sometimes New Orleans (where I live).

If you're curious about what I've been up to, you might find interest in the [talks](/talks.html) page.

This site is created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the theme is a mix of [Lanyon](https://lanyon.getpoole.com/) and [Tufte.css](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css/).
